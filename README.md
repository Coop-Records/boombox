### What is Boombox?

Boombox is a crypto consumer app to share your favorite artists and earn BOOM when other add them too.

Users sign-in to Boombox with Privy and connect their Spotify to pull their favorite artists.

Here they can add those artists to their Boombox using a native currency called BOOM - an onchain points system built on a Base L3.

Once adding an artist, fans can upgrade to higher fan tiers and join community message boards.

Every time someone adds an artist that you own in your Boombox - you earn BOOM.

### Key Info

Boombox has done 154k transactions since launch across 8.5k unique users and 2k unique artist communites - the vast majority of which have never touched crypto before.

More stats can be monitored using Boombox Watch.

This was accomplished by using the following stack:

Privy for onboarding
Stack for onchain points
Farcaster for go-to market
Base for redemptions
Boombox was a collaboration between Anthem and Coop Records - launched as a case study to find new ways to onboard users completely new to crypto.
